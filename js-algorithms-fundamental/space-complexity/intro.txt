How much space in memory does your alorithm occupy?

- All values in JS are stored in memory
- Especially arrays and objects can take up a bit more space

- Find place where data(values) is stored "permanently" in the algorithm
- Count how often such "permanently" stored values are being created and kept around
- Determine how the number of values depends on the "n"
- O(n), O(1), etc.

- not the most important dimension
